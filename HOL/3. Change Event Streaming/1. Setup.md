# Prepare the Database for CES

To get started, let's configure a database. We'll enable the database for Change Event Streaming (CES), create a stream group, and define stored procedures to simulate transactional activity.

## Create and Configure the Database

In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), connect to your local SQL Server 2025 instance and press `CTRL+N` to open a new query window.

Run the following T-SQL to create and use a new database for this lab. Be sure to suffix the database name with your first and last name to ensure isolation from other attendees sharing the same Event Hub and Blob Storage container (e.g., `CesDemo_john_smith`).

> **Note:** Use underscore `_` characters (not dashes `-`) for delimiters in the database name.

```sql
USE master
GO

CREATE DATABASE CesDemo_firstname_lastname
GO

USE CesDemo_firstname_lastname
GO
```

### Create the Database Master Key

You must create a database master key to securely store the credential to access the Azure Event Hub resource for this lab. This key is encrypted by a password. Only one master key is needed and permitted per database, so if it already exists from a previous lab, this command will not recreate it.

```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
  CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'H@rd2Gue$$P@$$w0rd'
```

### Create the Credential Used by CES

This credential holds the SAS token enabling access to the Event Hub that SQL Server will stream events to as data changes in the database. Replace the placeholder with the token provided by your instructor.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SqlCesCredential
WITH
  IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',
  SECRET = 'provided by the instructor'
```

## Create the Tables

We'll create a few tables to model a basic order processing system.

First create the `Customer` table and populate it with two customers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  CustomerId    int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerName  varchar(50),
  City          varchar(20)
)
GO

SET IDENTITY_INSERT Customer ON
INSERT INTO Customer
  (CustomerId,  CustomerName,               City) VALUES
  (1,           'Shutter Bros Wholesale',   'New York'),
  (2,           'Aperture Supply Co.',      'Los Angeles')
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Customer OFF
GO
```

Next, create and populate the `Product` table with a catalog of products:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
  ProductId     int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Name          varchar(80),
  Color         varchar(15),
  Category      varchar(20),
  UnitPrice     decimal(8, 2),
  ItemsInStock  smallint
)
GO

SET IDENTITY_INSERT Product ON
INSERT INTO Product
  (ProductId,   Name,                                   Color,      Category,       UnitPrice,  ItemsInStock) VALUES 
  (1,           'Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Camera',       'Black',    'Camera',       3899.99,    10),
  (2,           'Nikon Z6 II Mirrorless Camera',        'Silver',   'Camera',       1996.95,    8),
  (3,           'Sony NP-FZ100 Rechargeable Battery',   'Black',    'Accessory',    78.00,      25)
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Product OFF
GO
```

Finally, create the `Order` and `OrderDetail` tables. We'll populate them later with sample order data, and monitor the generated change events as orders are created, updated, or deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [Order] (
  OrderId       int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerId    int REFERENCES Customer(CustomerId),
  OrderDate     datetime2
)
GO

CREATE TABLE OrderDetail (
  OrderDetailId int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  OrderId       int REFERENCES [Order](OrderId),
  ProductId     int REFERENCES Product(ProductId),
  Quantity      smallint
)
GO
```

Finally, create and populate `TableWithNoPK`. This table will be used to demonstrate how CES behaves when a table lacks a primary key and does not include all columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableWithNoPK (
  Id        int IDENTITY,
  ItemName  varchar(50)
)
GO

INSERT INTO TableWithNoPK (ItemName) VALUES
  ('Camera'),
  ('Automobile'),
  ('Oven'),
  ('Couch')
GO
```

## Create a Trigger

This trigger ensures product stock levels are automatically updated when order lines are added, changed, or deleted. The purpose of this trigger is to demonstrate that Change Event Streaming can capture the "side-effect" on data changes resulting from triggers.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trgUpdateItemsInStock ON OrderDetail AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
  -- Handle insert
  IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock - i.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN inserted AS i ON p.ProductId = i.ProductId

  -- Handle update
  ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) AND UPDATE(Quantity)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock + d.Quantity - i.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN inserted AS i ON p.ProductId = i.ProductId
      INNER JOIN deleted AS d ON p.ProductId = d.ProductId

  -- Handle delete
  ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock + d.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN deleted AS d ON p.ProductId = d.ProductId
END
GO
```

With this trigger in place, any changes to the OrderDetail table will automatically adjust the stock levels in the Product table. This is a common pattern in order management systems to ensure inventory levels are always accurate. As a result, events for products affected by order detail changes will also be generated, demonstrating how CES captures cascading changes across related tables that leverage DML triggers.

## Create the Stored Procedures

Now create the following stored procedures:

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROC CreateOrder
  @CustomerId int
AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO [Order](CustomerId, OrderDate)
  VALUES (@CustomerId, SYSDATETIME())

  SELECT OrderId = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
END
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROC CreateOrderDetail
  @OrderId int,
  @ProductId int,
  @Quantity smallint
AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO OrderDetail (OrderId, ProductId, Quantity)
  VALUES (@OrderId, @ProductId, @Quantity)

  SELECT OrderDetailId = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
END
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROC DeleteOrder
  @OrderId int
AS
BEGIN
  BEGIN TRANSACTION
    DELETE FROM OrderDetail WHERE OrderId = @OrderId
    DELETE FROM [Order] WHERE OrderId = @OrderId
  COMMIT TRANSACTION
END
GO
```

Each stored procedure represents a key business operation:

- **CreateOrder**: Inserts a new order for a specified customer.

- **CreateOrderDetail**: Adds a line item to an existing order, specifying the product and quantity. In turn, this triggers an update to the `Product` table to adjust stock levels.

- **DeleteOrder**: Deletes an order and all its associated order details in a single transaction, ensuring data integrity. In turn, this will also trigger updates to the `Product` table to restore stock levels for any products that were part of the deleted order details.

        **Congratulations! You have CES-enabled your SQL Server database.**

        This concludes the setup for your Change Event Streaming environment. You now have a database ready to capture change events, and a stream group configured to send those events to Azure Event Hubs.

        In the next lab, you will create an Event Hub consumer client as a C# console application that receives and processes events.
