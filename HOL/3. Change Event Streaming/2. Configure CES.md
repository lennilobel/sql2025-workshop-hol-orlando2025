# Configure CES

Now we'll configure the database for Change Event Streaming (CES). This involves:

- Creating a database master key to securely store credentials.
- Creating a credential that holds the SAS token for accessing the Azure Event Hub.
- Enabling CES for the database.
- Creating a stream group that defines which tables to monitor and where to send change events.
- Adding specific tables to the stream group to capture their change events.
- Configuring how much data CES includes in the event payload for each table.

### Create the Database Master Key

You must create a database master key to securely store the credential to access the Azure Event Hub resource for this lab. This key is encrypted by a password. Only one master key is needed and permitted per database, so if it already exists from a previous lab, this command will not recreate it.

```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.symmetric_keys WHERE name = '##MS_DatabaseMasterKey##')
  CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'H@rd2Gue$$P@$$w0rd'
```

### Create the Credential Used by CES

This credential holds the SAS token enabling access to the Event Hub that SQL Server will stream events to as data changes in the database. Replace the placeholder with the token provided by your instructor.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL SqlCesCredential
WITH
  IDENTITY = 'SHARED ACCESS SIGNATURE',
  SECRET = 'provided by the instructor'
```

### Enable CES

Run the following query to verify that (at this stage) CES is currently not enabled on any databases:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE is_event_stream_enabled = 1
```

Now run this statement to enable CES for the current database. This allows SQL Server to start capturing change events for selected tables in the database.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_enable_event_stream
```

Now re-run the previous query to confirm CES is enabled for the current database (CesDemo):

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.databases WHERE is_event_stream_enabled = 1
```

### Create the Event Stream Group

Now let's create the stream group. This is a SQL Server concept that allows you to group multiple tables together for change event streaming. The group will be configured to send events to an specific Azure Event Hub.

> **IMPORTANT:** SQL Server *stream groups* should not to be confused with Event Hub *consumer groups*. As explained, the latter allows multiple consumers to share the same Azure Blob Storage container while maintaining checkpoint isolation. In SQL Server, stream groups are used to define the Event Hub to send changes made by all tables that get added to the stream group.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_create_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name      = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @destination_location   = 'sql2025-ces.servicebus.windows.net/ces-hub',
  @destination_credential = SqlCesCredential,
  @destination_type       = 'AzureEventHubsAmqp'
```

In this code:

- **@stream_group_name:** Creates an event stream group named `SqlCesGroup`

- **@destination_location:** Tells SQL Server to send change events to the Azure Event Hub at `sql2025-ces.servicebus.windows.net/ces-hub`.
  > This syntax describes an Event Hub named `ces-hub`, which exists in an Event Hub namespace named `sql2025-ces`.

- **@destination_credential:** The credential `SqlCesCredential` provides the necessary access permissions to the Event Hub, which you've already configured with the approprate SAS token.

- **@destination_type:** This parameter specifies that the events will be sent using the AMQP protocol, which is the standard for Azure Event Hubs.
  > AMQP stands for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, a protocol used for message-oriented middleware that allows for efficient and reliable message delivery.

## Add Tables to the Stream Group

To capture change events for specific tables, you need to add them to the stream group you created earlier. This tells SQL Server which tables to monitor for changes and how to handle those changes in terms of event payloads.

Link each table to the stream group and configure how much data CES includes in the event payload. Two key options control this:

* `@include_old_values`: When set to 1, CES includes the *previous* values of each column for UPDATE and DELETE operations. Use this when you want to compare old vs. new values.

* `@include_all_columns`: When set to 1, CES includes *all* columns of the row even if only one column changes. When set to 0, only primary key and changed columns are included.

In this lab:

* `Product`, `Order`, and `OrderLine` include old values to detect stock changes or order modifications.
* `Customer` does not include old values but does include all columns, which is useful for simpler data monitoring.
* `TableWithNoPK` includes neither old values nor all columns. This highlights the limitations of tracking change events on poorly defined schemas.

> Be sure to reference the same stream group name you created earlier, appending your first and last name to ensure uniqueness.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @object_name = 'dbo.Customer',
  @include_old_values = 0,      -- do not include old values columns that have changed from updates or deletes
  @include_all_columns = 1      -- include all columns, even those that haven't changed from updates or deletes

EXEC sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @object_name = 'dbo.Product',
  @include_old_values = 1,      -- include old values for columns that have changed from updates or deletes
  @include_all_columns = 0      -- include only columns that have changed from updates or deletes

EXEC sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @object_name = 'dbo.Order',
  @include_old_values = 1,      -- include old values for columns that have changed from updates or deletes
  @include_all_columns = 0      -- include only columns that have changed from updates or deletes

EXEC sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @object_name = 'dbo.OrderDetail',
  @include_old_values = 1,      -- include old values for columns that have changed from updates or deletes
  @include_all_columns = 0      -- include only columns that have changed from updates or deletes

EXEC sys.sp_add_object_to_event_stream_group
  @stream_group_name = 'SqlCesGroup',
  @object_name = 'dbo.TableWithNoPK',
  @include_old_values = 0,      -- do not include old values columns that have changed from updates or deletes
  @include_all_columns = 0      -- include only columns that have changed from updates or deletes (with no PK, this is essentially useless)
```

You can use `sp_help_change_feed_table` to inspect the current CES configuration for each table in your stream group. This will show you which tables are included, their old value settings, and other details:

```sql
EXEC sp_help_change_feed_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'Customer'
EXEC sp_help_change_feed_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'Product'
EXEC sp_help_change_feed_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'Order'
EXEC sp_help_change_feed_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'OrderDetail'
EXEC sp_help_change_feed_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'TableWithNoPK'
```

You can also query `sys.dm_change_feed_errors` to diagnose any issues with change event publishing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_change_feed_errors ORDER BY entry_time
```

**Congratulations! You have CES-enabled your SQL Server database.**

This concludes the setup for your Change Event Streaming environment. You now have an order processing database ready to capture change events, and a stream group configured to send those events to Azure Event Hubs.

In the next lab, you will create an Event Hub consumer client as a C# console application that receives and processes events.
