# Create the Sample CES Database

To get started, let's create a sample order processing database. We will then use Change Event Streaming to track changes to orders, customers, and products in this database, and stream those changes to an Azure Event Hub.

In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

* Right-click on the **Databases** node in Object Explorer and select **New Database** to open the New Database modal.
* Name the new database **CESDemo** and click OK. 
* Right-click on the new **CESDemo** database and select **New Query** to open a new query window.

## Create the Tables

First create the `Customer` table and populate it with two customers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  CustomerId    int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerName  varchar(50),
  City          varchar(20)
)
GO

SET IDENTITY_INSERT Customer ON
INSERT INTO Customer
  (CustomerId,  CustomerName,               City) VALUES
  (1,           'Shutter Bros Wholesale',   'New York'),
  (2,           'Aperture Supply Co.',      'Los Angeles')
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Customer OFF
GO
```

Next, create and populate the `Product` table with a catalog of products:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
  ProductId     int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Name          varchar(80),
  Color         varchar(15),
  Category      varchar(20),
  UnitPrice     decimal(8, 2),
  ItemsInStock  smallint
)
GO

SET IDENTITY_INSERT Product ON
INSERT INTO Product
  (ProductId,   Name,                                   Color,      Category,       UnitPrice,  ItemsInStock) VALUES 
  (1,           'Canon EOS R5 Mirrorless Camera',       'Black',    'Camera',       3899.99,    10),
  (2,           'Nikon Z6 II Mirrorless Camera',        'Silver',   'Camera',       1996.95,    8),
  (3,           'Sony NP-FZ100 Rechargeable Battery',   'Black',    'Accessory',    78.00,      25)
SET IDENTITY_INSERT Product OFF
GO
```

Now create the `Order` and `OrderDetail` tables. We'll populate them later with sample order data, and monitor the generated change events as orders are created, updated, or deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [Order] (
  OrderId       int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerId    int REFERENCES Customer(CustomerId),
  OrderDate     datetime2
)
GO

CREATE TABLE OrderDetail (
  OrderDetailId int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  OrderId       int REFERENCES [Order](OrderId),
  ProductId     int REFERENCES Product(ProductId),
  Quantity      smallint
)
GO
```

Finally, create and populate `TableWithNoPK`. This table will be used to demonstrate the challenge of using CES with a table that lacks a primary key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE TableWithNoPK (
  Id        int IDENTITY,
  ItemName  varchar(50)
)
GO

INSERT INTO TableWithNoPK (ItemName) VALUES
  ('Camera'),
  ('Automobile'),
  ('Oven'),
  ('Couch')
GO
```

## Create a Trigger

This trigger ensures product stock levels are automatically updated when order lines are added, changed, or deleted. As you'll soon see, Change Event Streaming also detects data changes that result from triggers, and streams events for those changes as well.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trgUpdateItemsInStock ON OrderDetail AFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
AS
BEGIN
  -- Handle insert
  IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock - i.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN inserted AS i ON p.ProductId = i.ProductId

  -- Handle update
  ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted) AND EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) AND UPDATE(Quantity)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock + d.Quantity - i.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN inserted AS i ON p.ProductId = i.ProductId
      INNER JOIN deleted AS d ON p.ProductId = d.ProductId

  -- Handle delete
  ELSE IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM deleted) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM inserted)
    UPDATE Product
    SET ItemsInStock = p.ItemsInStock + d.Quantity
    FROM
      Product AS p
      INNER JOIN deleted AS d ON p.ProductId = d.ProductId
END
GO
```

With this trigger in place, any changes to the OrderDetail table will automatically adjust the stock levels in the Product table. This is a common pattern in order management systems to ensure inventory levels are always accurate. As a result, events for products affected by order detail changes will also be generated, demonstrating how CES captures cascading changes across related tables that leverage DML triggers.

## Create the Stored Procedures

Now create the following stored procedures:

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROC CreateOrder
  @CustomerId int
AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO [Order](CustomerId, OrderDate)
  VALUES (@CustomerId, SYSDATETIME())

  SELECT OrderId = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
END
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROC CreateOrderDetail
  @OrderId int,
  @ProductId int,
  @Quantity smallint
AS
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO OrderDetail (OrderId, ProductId, Quantity)
  VALUES (@OrderId, @ProductId, @Quantity)

  SELECT OrderDetailId = SCOPE_IDENTITY()
END
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROC DeleteOrder
  @OrderId int
AS
BEGIN
  BEGIN TRANSACTION
    DELETE FROM OrderDetail WHERE OrderId = @OrderId
    DELETE FROM [Order] WHERE OrderId = @OrderId
  COMMIT TRANSACTION
END
GO
```

Each stored procedure represents a key business operation:

- **CreateOrder**: Inserts a new order for a specified customer.

- **CreateOrderDetail**: Adds a line item to an existing order, specifying the product and quantity. In turn, this triggers an update to the `Product` table to adjust stock levels.

- **DeleteOrder**: Deletes an order and all its associated order details in a single transaction, ensuring data integrity. In turn, this will also trigger updates to the `Product` table to restore stock levels for any products that were part of the deleted order details.

The database is now all setup for order processing. The next step is to configure the database for Change Event Streaming (CES), so that we can capture data changes and stream them to Azure Event Hubs.
