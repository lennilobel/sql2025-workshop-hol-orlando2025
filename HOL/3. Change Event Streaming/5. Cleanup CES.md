# Cleanup CES

A database cannot be dropped if it is configured for Change Event Streaming (that is, if it has active streaming groups and objects). So in order to clean up your environment, you need to first remove the tables from the streaming group and drop the stream group, before you can delete the database.

## Remove tables from the CES Stream Group

These statements remove the specified tables from the `SqlCesGroup` stream group. This is necessary before you can drop the stream group itself.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_remove_object_from_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup', 'dbo.Product'
EXEC sys.sp_remove_object_from_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup', 'dbo.Customer'
EXEC sys.sp_remove_object_from_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup', 'dbo.Order'
EXEC sys.sp_remove_object_from_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup', 'dbo.OrderDetail'
EXEC sys.sp_remove_object_from_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup', 'dbo.TableWithNoPK'
```

## Drop CES Stream Group

This statement drops the `SqlCesGroup` stream group, which is necessary before you can disable Change Event Streaming for the database.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_drop_event_stream_group 'SqlCesGroup'
```

## Disable Change Event Streaming

Finally, this statement disables Change Event Streaming for the database, allowing you to drop the database.

```sql
EXEC sys.sp_disable_event_stream
```

You'll stop short of deleting the database, since it is still needed for the rest of the workshop.
 
That's all for Change Event Streaming! You're now ready to move on to the next section of the workshop, where you'll explore the exciting new AI features in SQL Server 2025.
