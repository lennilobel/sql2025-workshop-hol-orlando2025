# Welcome!

Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of SQL Server, where you are about to dive deep into some of its most powerful and sophisticated features for developers. Through a series of carefully crafted hands-on labs, you will explore a variety of new capabilities introduced in SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL Database.

From exploring powerful new T-SQL enhancements like fuzzy string matching and regular expressions, to working hands-on with the new native JSON data type, JSON indexing, and enhanced JSON functions, these labs offer a deep dive into the latest developer capabilities in SQL Server 2025. You'll also gain practical experience with AI features including the vector data type, vector similarity search, the built-in embeddings model, and DiskANN indexing—all running natively in SQL Server. You'll also discover the new Change Event Streaming feature, which lets you stream change data directly from SQL Server into Azure Event Hubs for real-time integration scenarios. Each lab is designed to be hands-on and incremental, building your knowledge step by step so you can confidently apply these features in real-world applications.

The labs you'll engage with involve a practical, hands-on approach where you'll open a new query window in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and either copy/paste code from the prepared lab content or type out code snippets yourself. You'll start with a single snippet, and as the lab progresses, you'll add new snippets to the bottom of your script. This methodical build-up allows you to construct a full script step by step, providing a clear understanding of how each part contributes to the whole, enhancing both learning and retention.

But remember, learning is not just about acquiring new skills—it's also about having fun and enjoying the process! These labs are your playground for experimentation, offering you the chance to explore, make mistakes, and discover solutions firsthand. So, embrace this opportunity with enthusiasm and curiosity, and let's embark on this educational adventure together. By the end of this journey, you'll not only have a deeper understanding of SQL Server's developer features but also a greater appreciation for the art of database management and security, as well as the exciting possibilities of AI-driven functionality. Let the learning—and the fun—begin!
