# RAG Solution

This lab implements a primitive **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern. RAG is a technique that enhances AI-generated responses by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before passing them into a language model. Instead of relying solely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge, RAG dynamically incorporates external data, allowing it to provide more contextually relevant and accurate responses. A full RAG solution doesn't just perform vector search—it takes the raw vector search results and transforms them into a natural language response using a pre-trained **chat completions model**. This means we are moving beyond merely retrieving semantically similar records, and into generating conversational, human-friendly responses, based on the retrieved data.

This is the same architecture used by AI copilots, assistants, and RAG-based applications—now implemented directly inside SQL Server 2025.

## Create the SearchProductsReturningJson Stored Procedure

[GPT: Add pre-code snippet explanatory text]

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE SearchProductsReturningJson
  @QueryText      nvarchar(max),
  @JsonResults    nvarchar(max) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN

  DECLARE @Results TABLE (
    ProductName         nvarchar(max),
    ProductDescription  nvarchar(max),
    SafetyStockLevel    smallint,
    Distance            decimal(19, 16)
  )

  INSERT INTO @Results
  EXEC SearchProductsANN
    @QueryText     = @QueryText,
    @MinStockLevel = 100,
    @MaxDistance   = .2,
    @Top           = 20

  SELECT @JsonResults = (
    SELECT
      ProductName,
      ProductDescription
    FROM
      @Results
    FOR JSON AUTO
  )

END
GO
```

## Create the AskProductQuestion Stored Procedure

```sql

    You are an assistant that helps people find bicycle and related products from vectorized
    product descriptions in the AdventureWorks2022 database. Your demeanor is upbeat and
    friendly.
    
    A vector search returns product results similar to a natural language query posed by the user.
    Your job is to take the raw results of the vector search and generate a natural language
    response that starts with a sentence or two related to the user''s question, followed by
    the details of each product in the search results.

    Do not include markdown syntax, such as double asterisks or pound signs. Do not include emojis either.

    Include all the products returned by the vector search, even those that don''t relate to the user''s
    question. However, call out those products that don''t relate to the user''s question. If there are no
    product results, apologize and explain that there are no products to suggest.
    
    If the user asks a question unrelated to products, try to answer it anyway, but stress that your primary
    purpose is to help with bicycles and related products in the database.

## What You’ve Built

You now have a **full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow inside SQL Server 2025 using:

* Real product data from **AdventureWorks2022**
* Embeddings generated by **Azure OpenAI**
* Vector search powered by the **vector** type and **DiskANN**
* Conversational summaries using **chat completions**

This pattern can be reused for any domain: from product catalogs to service manuals, employee training records, or support tickets.
