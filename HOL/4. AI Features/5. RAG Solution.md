# RAG Solution

This lab implements a primitive **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern. RAG is a technique that enhances AI-generated responses by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before passing them into a language model. Instead of relying solely on the model’s pre-trained knowledge, RAG dynamically incorporates external data, allowing it to provide more contextually relevant and accurate responses. A full RAG solution doesn't just perform vector search—it takes the raw vector search results and transforms them into a natural language response using a pre-trained **chat completions model**. This means we are moving beyond merely retrieving semantically similar records, and into generating conversational, human-friendly responses, based on the retrieved data.

This is the same architecture used by AI copilots, assistants, and RAG-based applications—now implemented directly inside SQL Server 2025.

> **Note:** This lab extends the previous labs. You must have completed the entire previous set of AdventureWorks2022 labs to have the necessary data and procedures in place.

## Create the `SearchProductsReturningJson` Stored Procedure

Before we can ask GPT-style models to generate natural language responses, we need to prepare the data as text. That means converting our semantic search results (rows returned from a vector search) into a single JSON string.

This stored procedure wraps our existing `SearchProductsANN` procedure and:

* Captures the result set into a table variable
* Converts it into a JSON array using `FOR JSON AUTO`
* Returns the JSON string through an output parameter

This JSON string will later be embedded into a user prompt for the GPT model.

```sql
USE AdventureWorks2022
GO

CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE SearchProductsReturningJson
  @QueryText      nvarchar(max),
  @JsonResults    nvarchar(max) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN

  DECLARE @Results TABLE (
    ProductName         nvarchar(max),
    ProductDescription  nvarchar(max),
    SafetyStockLevel    smallint,
    Distance            decimal(19, 16)
  )

  INSERT INTO @Results
  EXEC SearchProductsANN
    @QueryText     = @QueryText,
    @MinStockLevel = 100,
    @MaxDistance   = .2,
    @Top           = 20

  SELECT @JsonResults = (
    SELECT
      ProductName,
      ProductDescription
    FROM
      @Results
    FOR JSON AUTO
  )

END
GO
```

This encapsulation gives you a reusable way to turn vector search results from tabular format into text-based JSON. It’s a bridge between your SQL Server data and the language model’s input expectations, which is always text-based.

Test the stored procedure with a sample question, capture the output JSON into a variable, and display the JSON result. This is what you’ll feed into the chat model in the next step.

> **Tip:** The output will be quite long, so consider using the JSON Formatter tool from the JSON labs to view it more easily.

```sql
DECLARE @JsonResults nvarchar(max)
EXEC SearchProductsReturningJson 'Show me the best products for riding on rough ground', @JsonResults OUTPUT
SELECT @JsonResults
GO
```

You should see a JSON array of products that semantically match the query—essentially the same results we received for the vector search as we've run before, only converted from a tabular (rows and columns) format into a single JSON string.

## Create the `AskProductQuestion` Stored Procedure

With vector search results in hand, the next step is to transform them into a conversational answer using a GPT model hosted in Azure OpenAI.

This procedure:

* Accepts the user’s original question and the JSON results from vector search
* Builds a structured prompt including system and user instructions
* Calls the Azure OpenAI chat completions endpoint (`/chat/completions`)
* Extracts the generated reply from the response JSON
* Returns it via an output parameter

The system prompt tells the assistant how to behave. The user prompt includes the actual question and the search results.

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE AskProductQuestion
  @ProductQuestion varchar(max),
  @JsonResults varchar(max),
  @ProductAnswer varchar(max) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN

  DECLARE @SystemPrompt varchar(max) = '
    You are an assistant that helps people find bicycle and related products from vectorized
    product descriptions in the AdventureWorks2022 database. Your demeanor is upbeat and
    friendly.
    
    A vector search returns product results similar to a natural language query posed by the user.
    Your job is to take the raw results of the vector search and generate a natural language
    response that starts with a sentence or two related to the user''s question, followed by
    the details of each product in the search results.

    Do not include markdown syntax, such as double asterisks or pound signs. Do not include emojis either.

    Include all the products returned by the vector search, even those that don''t relate to the user''s
    question. However, call out those products that don''t relate to the user''s question. If there are no
    product results, apologize and explain that there are no products to suggest.
    
    If the user asks a question unrelated to products, try to answer it anyway, but stress that your primary
    purpose is to help with bicycles and related products in the database.
  '

  DECLARE @UserPrompt varchar(max) = CONCAT('
    The user asked "', @ProductQuestion, '", and the vector search returned the following products: ', @JsonResults, '
  ')

  DECLARE @OpenAIEndpoint varchar(max) = 'https://ai-sql-hol.openai.azure.com/'
  DECLARE @OpenAIDeploymentName varchar(max) = 'gpt-4o'

  DECLARE @Url varchar(max) = CONCAT(@OpenAIEndpoint, 'openai/deployments/', @OpenAIDeploymentName, '/chat/completions?api-version=2023-05-15')
  DECLARE @Payload varchar(max) = JSON_OBJECT(
    'messages': JSON_ARRAY(
      JSON_OBJECT('role': 'system', 'content': @SystemPrompt),
      JSON_OBJECT('role': 'user', 'content': @UserPrompt)
    ),
    'max_tokens': 1000,
    'temperature': 1.0,
    'frequency_penalty': 0.0,
    'presence_penalty': 0.0,
    'top_p': 0.95
  )

  DECLARE @Response nvarchar(max)
  DECLARE @ReturnValue int

  EXEC @ReturnValue = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
    @url = @Url,
    @method = 'POST',
    @credential = [https://ai-sql-hol.openai.azure.com/],
    @payload = @Payload,
    @response = @Response OUTPUT

  IF @ReturnValue != 0
    THROW 50000, @Response, 1

  SET @ProductAnswer = JSON_VALUE(@Response, '$.result.choices[0].message.content')

END
GO
```

This procedure abstracts all the complexity of calling Azure OpenAI. You simply give it a question and a JSON string of matching products, and it returns a helpful, human-like answer.

Now test the stored procedure with a simple query unrelated to our data, and an empty JSON array (simulating no search results).

```sql
DECLARE @ProductAnswer varchar(max)
EXEC AskProductQuestion 'What is the capital of France?', '[]', @ProductAnswer OUTPUT
PRINT @ProductAnswer 
GO
```

The response should indicate it’s designed to help with bicycles and related products, but still correctly respond that the capital of France is Paris.

## Create the `ProductAssistant` Stored Procedure

Finally, we’ll compose everything into one simple procedure that does it all:

* Receives a natural language product-related question
* Runs a semantic vector search against your product catalog
* Converts the results into JSON
* Calls GPT to generate a conversational response
* Prints the answer

This is the single entry point you’d call from a chatbot, app, or API.

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE ProductAssistant @ProductQuestion nvarchar(max)
AS
BEGIN

  SET NOCOUNT ON

  -- Run a vector search and capture the results as JSON
  DECLARE @JsonResults nvarchar(max)
  EXEC SearchProductsReturningJson @ProductQuestion, @JsonResults OUTPUT

  -- Call the GPT model to generate the natural language response from the raw JSON results
  DECLARE @ProductAnswer nvarchar(max)
  EXEC AskProductQuestion @ProductQuestion, @JsonResults, @ProductAnswer OUTPUT
  PRINT @ProductAnswer

END
GO
```

This procedure represents the full RAG pipeline—triggered entirely from a single T-SQL command.

Try out the assistant using the same set of realistic product questions to see how the system performs. Under the covers, we are running the same ANN vector search as before. The difference is that now we are generating a natural language response based on the search results, rather than just returning the raw data.

Run these commands (one at a time) to see the assistant in action:

```sql
EXEC ProductAssistant 'Show me the best products for riding on rough ground'
EXEC ProductAssistant 'Recommend a bike that is good for riding around the city'
EXEC ProductAssistant 'Looking for budget-friendly gear for beginners just getting into cycling'
EXEC ProductAssistant 'What''s best for long-distance rides with storage for travel gear?'
EXEC ProductAssistant 'Do you have any yellow or red bikes?'
EXEC ProductAssistant 'Do you have any yellow or red apples?'
```

The last input intentionally asks for something unrelated to test how well the assistant gracefully handles non-product or mismatched queries.

## What You’ve Built

You now have a primitive yet functional **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow inside SQL Server 2025 using:

* Real product data from **AdventureWorks2022**
* Embeddings generated by **Azure OpenAI**
* Vector search powered by the **vector** type and **DiskANN**
* Conversational responses using **chat completions**

This pattern can be reused for any domain: from product catalogs to service manuals, employee training records, support tickets, and just about any other text-based knowledge base you could think of.
