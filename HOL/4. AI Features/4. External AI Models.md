# External AI Models

In the previous lab, we secured access to Azure OpenAI by hiding the API key inside a database-scoped credential. This allows developers to call the `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` procedure without exposing the key directly in T-SQL (as we did in our very first lab using the `Movies` database). By securing access to the API key inside the credential, only privileged database users can view or modify it, while regular developers are limited to referencing it indirectly via the credential.

But SQL Server 2025 takes security even further by supporting **external AI models**, which encapsulate not just the credential but also the **endpoint URL and deployed model name**. This is important because if a developer were able to change the endpoint or the deployed model, they could unknowingly (or maliciously) point to an inappropriate model—causing anything from poor search quality to completely misleading and even dangerous content. Indeed, the results could be disastrous.

By using external models (instead of calling `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` directly), the model invocation is fully abstracted. Developers using the external model no longer have any control over the API key, endpoint URL, or deployed model name, nor can they accidentally (or intentionally) point to the wrong model. Instead, all of that configuration is encapsulated in the external model definition itself, and access to the model is governed strictly by role-based permissions.

> **Note:** Behind the scenes, external AI models still call `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` to access Azure OpenAI, just as we've been doing explicitly up to this point. Therefore, you will still need to enable external REST endpoints on the database the server with `EXEC sp_configure 'external rest endpoint enabled', 1` (which we already did at the start of the first lab), even though you are no longer explicitly invoking the endpoint yourself.

Let's get started with external AI models.

## Clear the Vectors

We are going to re-vectorize the entire table using an external model, so first let's clear out all the vectors from the previous lab. Remember though, before we can do that, we need to delete the existing DiskANN index on the `Production.ProductVector` table. This is necessary due to the current limitation in SQL Server 2025 in which a table with a vector column becomes readonly once a DiskANN index has been defined for it.

```sql
-- Delete existing DiskANN index to re-enable writes to the table
DROP INDEX ProductVectorDiskANNIndex ON Production.ProductVector
GO
```

This command removes the DiskANN index from `Production.ProductVector`, allowing us to perform updates to the table again. After executing this command, you should see a message indicating that the index has been dropped successfully.

Now we can clear out all the vectors in the table from the previous lab:

```sql
-- Clear previous vectors
UPDATE Production.ProductVector SET ProductVector = NULL
GO
```

Query the table to observe that the `ProductVector` column is now empty:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Production.ProductVector
GO
```

We're now ready to re-populate the `ProductVector` column—this time using an external model.

# Create the External AI Model

External AI models encapsulate the credential, endpoint, and deployed model name, providing a secure way to access AI functionality without exposing sensitive details to developers. This is notably critical in production environments where security and access control are paramount.

Furthermore, access to these external models can be explicitly granted or denied to individual users or roles, offering fine-grained control over who is permitted to perform AI operations.

To demonstrate, create two roles for permission-based access: one role for users allowed to call the external model, and one for users who are denied access.

```sql
-- Create roles
CREATE ROLE AIRole      -- Members in this role can access the external model
CREATE ROLE NonAIRole   -- Members in this role cannot access the external model
```

Next, create four database users for different developers. Some will be granted access to use the external model; others will not.

```sql
-- Create users
CREATE USER AIUser1 WITHOUT LOGIN
CREATE USER AIUser2 WITHOUT LOGIN
CREATE USER NonAIUser1 WITHOUT LOGIN
CREATE USER NonAIUser2 WITHOUT LOGIN
```

Now assign users to their appropriate roles:

```sql
-- Add users to roles
ALTER ROLE AIRole ADD MEMBER AIUser1
ALTER ROLE AIRole ADD MEMBER AIUser2
ALTER ROLE NonAIRole ADD MEMBER NonAIUser1
ALTER ROLE NonAIRole ADD MEMBER NonAIUser2
```

Remember that the external model references the database-scoped credential that stores the Azure OpenAI API key. So we must grant the `AIRole` role permission to reference that credential.

```sql
-- Grant AIRole users permission to access the database scoped credential that the model uses
GRANT REFERENCES ON DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL::[https://ai-sql-hol.openai.azure.com/] TO AIRole
```

Now we'll define the external model. This encapsulates:

* The **Azure OpenAI endpoint**
* The **deployed model name**
* The **API format** and **model type**
* The **credential** used to authenticate

```sql
-- Create the model that can only be accessed by AIRole members
CREATE EXTERNAL MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel
AUTHORIZATION AIRole
WITH (
  LOCATION = 'https://ai-sql-hol.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/text-embedding-ada-002/embeddings?api-version=2023-03-15-preview',,
  API_FORMAT = 'Azure OpenAI',
  MODEL_TYPE = EMBEDDINGS,
  MODEL = 'text-embedding-ada-002',
  CREDENTIAL = [https://ai-sql-hol.openai.azure.com/],
)
GO
```

Notice how the `AUTHORIZATION` clause specifies `AIRole`, so only members of that role will be able to use this external model.

Let’s now test access from different user contexts. Your current user context (based on your current login) should be `dbo`. To confirm this, run the following query to check your current user context:

```sql
SELECT USER_NAME()
```

Note that `dbo` is a special database user in SQL Server that is implicitly granted full permissions. And so you should be able to successfully call the external model even though `dbo` was not added as a member of `AIRole`.

```sql
DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
SELECT @Vector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS('Sample text to be vectorized' USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)

SELECT
  Vector      = @Vector,
  Dimensions  = VECTORPROPERTY(@Vector, 'Dimensions'),
  BaseType    = VECTORPROPERTY(@Vector, 'BaseType'),
  Magnitude   = VECTOR_NORM(@Vector, 'norm2'),      -- Very close to 1 but not exactly 1, because a rounding error accumulates when you square 1536 values, sum them, and then take the square root
  Normalized  = VECTOR_NORMALIZE(@Vector, 'norm2')  -- Being already normalized, this should return the same vector values
GO
```

This query generates a vector embedding for the sample text and retrieves its properties, confirming that user `dbo` can access the external model.

See how now, the T-SQL code is calling Azure OpenAI indirectly, via the new `AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS(... USE MODEL <external-model>)` function. The specified external model holds all the required configuration information, including the endpoint, underlying model deployment, and database scoped credential. The function then calls Azure OpenAI via `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` using the API key stored in the database scoped credential.

So now impersonate a user who should **not** have access. The following should fail, since `NonAIUser1` is not a member of the authorized `AIRole` role:

```sql
-- Test as NonAIUser1 (should fail)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'NonAIUser1'
GO

DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
SELECT @Vector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS('Sample text to be vectorized' USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)
```

Use the `REVERT` command to end impersonation and return to your original `dbo` user context:

```sql
REVERT
```

Try again with another user who should also **not** have access to the external model:

```sql
-- Test as NonAIUser2 (should fail)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'NonAIUser2'

DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
SELECT @Vector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS('Sample text to be vectorized' USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)
```

Once again, the command fails for a non-`dbo` user who is not a member of `AIRole`. This demonstrates that the external model is correctly secured, preventing unauthorized access.

Return to the `dbo` user context again to continue testing:

```sql
REVERT
```

Now for the happy path. Let's test with users who **are** members of `AIRole`, and who should be able to successfully call the external model. For example, testing with `AIUser1`:

```sql
-- Test as AIUser1 (should succeed)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'AIUser1'

DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
SELECT @Vector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS('Sample text to be vectorized' USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)
SELECT @Vector

REVERT
GO
```

Likewise, testing with `AIUser2` should also succeed:

```sql
-- Test as AIUser2 (should succeed)
EXECUTE AS USER = 'AIUser2'

DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
SELECT @Vector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS('Sample text to be vectorized' USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)
SELECT @Vector

REVERT
GO
```

This security model ensures that only authorized users can interact with external AI functionality. Furthermore, even authorized users are still be prevented from accessing the external model		configuration (API key, endpoint, and deployed model name).


With the external model now defined and tested, we can proceed to use it for vectorization.

# Re-vectorize the Products using the External Model

Once again, we'll use a cursor to loop through each product, generate a fresh embedding using the external model, and update the corresponding row. Only this time, note how `AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS(... USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)` effectively replaces our `VectorizeText` stored procedure (in fact, given the external model, we no longer need the `VectorizeText` stored procedure at all):

```sql
-- Re-vectorize using the external model
SET NOCOUNT ON

DECLARE @ProductName nvarchar(max)
DECLARE @ProductDescription nvarchar(max)
DECLARE @ProductID int
DECLARE @ProductDescriptionID int

DECLARE ProductCursor CURSOR FOR
  SELECT
    p.Name,
    pd.Description,
    p.ProductID,
    pd.ProductDescriptionID
  FROM
    Production.ProductVector                  AS pv
    INNER JOIN Production.Product             AS p  ON p.ProductId = pv.ProductId
    INNER JOIN Production.ProductDescription  AS pd ON pd.ProductDescriptionID = pv.ProductDescriptionID
  ORDER BY
    p.Name

OPEN ProductCursor

  FETCH NEXT FROM ProductCursor INTO @ProductName, @ProductDescription, @ProductID, @ProductDescriptionID
  
  DECLARE @Counter int = 1
  
  WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
  BEGIN

    DECLARE @ProductText nvarchar(max) = (SELECT 'Name: ' || @ProductName || ', Description: ' || @ProductDescription)
    
    DECLARE @Message nvarchar(max) = @Counter || ' - ' || @ProductText
    RAISERROR(@Message, 0, 1) WITH NOWAIT

    DECLARE @ProductVector vector(1536)
    SELECT @ProductVector = AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS(@ProductText USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel)	--	<- replaces EXEC VectorizeText

    UPDATE Production.ProductVector
    SET ProductVector = @ProductVector
    WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
    
    FETCH NEXT FROM ProductCursor INTO @ProductName, @ProductDescription, @ProductID, @ProductDescriptionID
    
    SET @Counter += 1

  END

CLOSE ProductCursor
DEALLOCATE ProductCursor
SET NOCOUNT OFF

GO
```

This code is identical to the previous lab's cursor-based vectorization, except that it now uses the `AI_GENERATE_EMBEDDINGS` function with the `USE MODEL ProductTextEmbeddingModel` clause to generate embeddings using the external model instead of our (now-obsolete) `VectorizeText` stored procedure.

As before, this code processes each product, emits live status messages, and stores the newly generated vector in the table—all without exposing any sensitive AI infrastructure details to the developer.

> **Tip:** Click the **Messages** tab to monitor the vectorization progress generated from the `RAISERROR` messages.

Once vector embeddings are generated for all 294 products, we can inspect them and confirm that they have the expected structure and properties:

```sql
-- Examine the generated product vectors
SELECT
  p.Name,
  pd.Description,
  pv.ProductID,
  pv.ProductDescriptionID,
  pv.ProductVector,
  Dimensions  = VECTORPROPERTY(ProductVector, 'Dimensions'),
  BaseType    = VECTORPROPERTY(ProductVector, 'BaseType'),
  Magnitude   = VECTOR_NORM(ProductVector, 'norm2'),
  Normalized  = VECTOR_NORMALIZE(ProductVector, 'norm2')
FROM
  Production.ProductVector                  AS pv
  INNER JOIN Production.Product             AS p   ON p.ProductID = pv.ProductID			
  INNER JOIN Production.ProductDescription  AS pd  ON pd.ProductDescriptionID = pv.ProductDescriptionID

GO
```

As before, observe that the `ProductVector` column now has vectors for each product, the `Dimensions` column shows that each vector has 1536 dimensions, the `BaseType` indicates `float32`, the `Magnitude` is 1 (or very close to it), and `Normalized` shows the same value as `ProductVector`, since thevectors provided by Azure OpenAI are already normalized.

Finally, recreate the DiskANN index on the `ProductVector` column so that fast, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) queries can be run. The syntax is identical to the same statement we ran in the previous lab:

```sql
-- Recreate the vector index
CREATE VECTOR INDEX ProductVectorDiskANNIndex
  ON Production.ProductVector (ProductVector)
  WITH (
    METRIC = 'cosine',
    TYPE = 'diskann',
    MAXDOP = 8
)
GO
```

The `ProductVector` table is once again ready for scalable semantic search. This completes the transition to a secure, production-ready embedding pipeline using **external AI models**—the most robust way to operationalize AI in SQL Server 2025.
