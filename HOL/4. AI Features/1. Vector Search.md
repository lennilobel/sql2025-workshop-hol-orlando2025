# Vector Search

In this lab, you will learn how to integrate AI capabilities into SQL Server using the new `vector` data type and the new `VECTOR_DISTANCE` T-SQL function.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Store and manage vector embeddings** using SQL Server's native `vector` data type.
- **Generate AI-based vector embeddings** using Azure OpenAI.
- **Perform similarity searches** using SQL Server’s native `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function.

With vector embeddings from deeply trained AI models, SQL Server can find results based on *meaning*, not just words.

Each attendee will create their own database and will use pre-configured AI models.

### What Is a Vector?

A **vector** is a list of numbers (typically floating point numbers) generated from a deeply trained AI **text embedding model** that represents the **semantic meaning** of a piece of text. Vectors can then be compared for similarity or distance. For example, notice how the close together the vector values of "The Godfather" and "Crime Drama" are, indicating similarity. In contrast, the "Screwball Comedy" vector values are relatively distant from the other two vector values.

| Text                 | Vector Representation |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| "The Godfather"      | `[0.45, -0.12, 0.98, ...]`    |
| "Crime Drama"        | `[0.44, -0.10, 0.95, ...]`    |
| "Screwball Comedy"   | `[0.78, -0.02, 0.58, ...]`    |

Simply put, the **closer together** two vectors are, the more similar (less distant) they are. Conversely, the **farther apart** they are, the less similar (more distant) they are.

## Enable External REST Endpoints in SQL Server

Before we can use Azure OpenAI to generate vector embeddings, we need to enable support for calling external REST endpoints from SQL Server. This is done using the `sp_configure` system stored procedure, which allows us to configure various server options.

- Connect to SQL Server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

- Press `CTRL+N` to open a new query window.

Then run the following code to enable the `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` system stored procedure. This is what allows SQL Server to call external REST APIs (such as Azure OpenAI).

```sql
-- Enable REST API support for the system procedure sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
USE master
GO

EXEC sp_configure 'external rest endpoint enabled', 1
GO
RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
GO
```

## Create the Movies Database

Next, we will create a new database named `Movies` to store our movie titles and their vector embeddings. This database will be used to demonstrate how to use AI-powered vector search in SQL Server.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Movies
GO

USE Movies
GO
```

## Create and Populate the Movie Table

Now, we will create a simple table to store movie titles and their AI-generated vectors.

### Why Are We Storing Movie Titles?

We will use movie titles as our dataset because:

1. It’s the simplest dataset to help focus on learning AI concepts.
2. It allows us to see how deeply trained AI models understand relationships between words.
3. We can use AI-powered search to match movies based on meaning.

### Table Structure

Create a table named `Movie` with three columns:

1. `MovieId` - A unique identifier.
2. `Title` - The movie title.
3. `Vector` - A `vector(1536)` column that will store AI-generated embeddings with 1536 dimensions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Movie (
  MovieId int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Title varchar(50),
  Vector vector(1536)
)
GO
```

Next, insert four movies:

```sql
INSERT INTO Movie (Title) VALUES
  ('Return of the Jedi'),
  ('The Godfather'),
  ('Animal House'),
  ('The Two Towers')
```

From a pop-culture perspective, many of you might recognize these movie titles and associate them with a wide range of attributes, such as particular phrases, actors, characters, settings, genres, and more. But just to keep the demo interesting and fun, go ahead and insert a few more titles of your own personal favorite movies.

Now query the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie
GO
```

At this stage, you can see that the **Vector** column is `NULL`. In the next steps, we will **generate AI-powered embeddings** and store them in this column.

## Create a Stored Procedure to Vectorize Text

Now, we will create a stored procedure that calls Azure OpenAI to generate vectors for each movie title in the database, and each natural language query supplied by users. This stored produce will:

- **Send text** (movie titles and user queries) to Azure OpenAI.
- **Receive a vector** representation (an array of floating point numbers) that captures the semantic meaning of the input text.

### Vector Size Considerations

We are going to generate vectors using OpenAI's **text-embedding-3-large** model, which **returns 3072-dimensional vectors** (that is, where each vector contains 3072 floating point numbers). However, **SQL Server currently only supports vectors up to 1998 dimensions**.

To fit within this limit, we will request Azure OpenAI to compress the vectors to 1536 dimensions. This will allow us to:

- Store vectors inside the `vector(1536)` column in the `Movie` table.  
- Preserve high accuracy while reducing storage size.  
- Ensure compatibility with SQL Server’s current vector limit.  

Note that this compression **minimally affects accuracy**. OpenAI optimizes dimensionality reduction to **retain meaningful vector relationships**, while enjoying a 50% smaller storage footprint. Although SQL Server currently supports up to **1998** dimensions, we can expect high accuracy with the **text-embedding-3-large** model even when we compress each 3072-dimensional vector down to 1536 dimensions.

- **Tip:** In fact, even when SQL Server eventually does support more than 1998 dimensions, you'll still want to compress vectors before storing them in the database. You will need to experiment to find the right compression that strikes the best balance between lowest storage cost, best performance, and least negative impact on vector search accuracy.

### Create the stored procedure

Copy and paste the following T-SQL script in to the query window to create the `VectorizeText` stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE VectorizeText
  @Text varchar(max),
  @Vector vector(1536) OUTPUT
AS
BEGIN

  -- Azure OpenAI endpoint
  DECLARE @OpenAIEndpoint varchar(max) = 'https://lenni-openai.openai.azure.com/'
  DECLARE @OpenAIDeploymentName varchar(max) = 'lenni-text-embedding-3-large' -- returns 3072-dimensional vectors
  DECLARE @OpenAIVersion varchar(max) = '2023-05-15'
  DECLARE @Url varchar(max) = CONCAT(@OpenAIEndpoint, 'openai/deployments/', @OpenAIDeploymentName, '/embeddings?api-version=', @OpenAIVersion)

  -- Azure OpenAI API key
  DECLARE @OpenAIApiKey varchar(max) = 'provided by the instructor'
  DECLARE @Headers varchar(max) = JSON_OBJECT('api-key': @OpenAIApiKey)

  -- Payload includes the text to be vectorized, and requests compression of 3072-dimensional vectors to 1536
  DECLARE @Payload varchar(max) = JSON_OBJECT('input': @Text, 'dimensions': 1536)

  -- Response and return value
  DECLARE @Response nvarchar(max)
  DECLARE @ReturnValue int

  -- Call Azure OpenAI to get vector representation
  EXEC @ReturnValue = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
    @url = @Url,
    @method = 'POST',
    @headers = @Headers,
    @payload = @Payload,
    @response = @Response OUTPUT

  -- Print raw JSON vector to the console
  PRINT SUBSTRING(JSON_QUERY(@Response, '$.result.data[0].embedding'), 1, 85) + '...'

  -- Handle API errors
  IF @ReturnValue != 0
    THROW 50000, @Response, 1

  -- Extract vector from JSON response
  DECLARE @VectorJson nvarchar(max) = JSON_QUERY(@Response, '$.result.data[0].embedding')

  -- Convert JSON vector to SQL Server's vector type
  SET @Vector = CONVERT(vector(1536), @VectorJson)
END
GO
```

On the `DECLARE @OpenAIApiKey` line, change the placeholder for the API key to the value supplied by the lab instructor. Then execute the code to create the stored procedure.

### How it Works

Let's carefully review how this code works. The stored procedure accepts any text and uses `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` to call Azure OpenAI. It passes in the text, receives a vector back from Azure OpenAI, and returns the result via an output parameter declared as the `vector(1536)` data type.

Observe how the call is constructed from these components:

1. The URL starts with an endpoint to the Azure OpenAI model deployment, which was copied and pasted in from the Azure portal. For this lab, the endpoint is `https://lenni-openai.openai.azure.com/`.
1. The URL resumes with `openai/deployments/`, followed by the
name of the Azure OpenAI text embedding model that has been deployed in advance of this lab, which is `text-embedding-3-large`. This is a deeply trained text embedding model that returns vectors with 3072 dimensions, available via Azure OpenAI.
1. The URL terminates with `/embeddings`, and a query string parameter that specifies the version of the OpenAI API that the request should use.
1. The HTTP method used to call Azure OpenAI is a `POST`.
1. The HTTP headers supply the model's API key. **This should always be kept secret,** since call consumption will be **billed** to the associated Azure subscription. You can and should also enable a network firewall around your Azure resource that blocks access to all but authorized
clients.
    - **Note**: For this lab, you are using an API key provided by the lab instructor to access an Azure OpenAI resource with no firewall.
1. The payload supplies the actual text to be vectorized as `input`, which was passed in to the stored procedure as the `@Text` parameter. It also specifies `dimensions` to request that Azure OpenAI return a compressed version (1536 dimensions) of the vector returned by the `text-embedding-3-large` model (which provides 3072 dimensions), in order to accommodate the current (preview) SQL Server vector size limit of 1998 dimensions.

The Azure OpenAI response is then handled as follows:

1. If the API call fails, the stored procedure throws an error.
1. If the API call succeeds, the vector is retrieved from the JSON response. Specifically, it is extracted from the `embedding` property of the first element in the `data` array of the `result` property in the response.
    - **Tip:** This scenario is only vectorizing one piece of text per API call, but you can also vectorize **multiple** pieces of text in a **single** API call. In that case, you would retrieve the vector returned for each piece of text from corresponding elements of the response's `result.data` array.
1. Finally, the raw JSON vector from the response is converted to a native `vector` data type in SQL Server, sized at 1536 dimensions (this matches the number of dimensions returned by the `text-embedding-3-large` model, after being compressed from 3072 down to 1536). This value is returned in the stored procedure's `@Vector` output parameter.

### Test the Stored Procedure

Now run the stored procedure to vectorize any arbitrary piece of text:

```sql
DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)
EXEC VectorizeText 'Vectorize this text', @Vector OUTPUT
SELECT @Vector
GO
```

If everything is working properly, you should see the first few floating point values in the vector array returned by Azure OpenAI (note that SQL Server expresses these values using scientific notation).

Now check the **Messages** tab to see the raw JSON vector generated by the `PRINT` statement. Notice how the first few vector elements in the JSON response match the first few values in SQL Server’s **vector(1536)** column.

While these numbers aren't human readable, they describe a pattern that captures the **semantic meaning** of the vectorized text, based on the deeply trained text embedding model in Azure OpenAI.

## Vectorize the Movies

Now we will populate the Vector column for all the movie titles in our database. Currently, our **Movie** table has `NULL` values in the **Vector** column. To populate this column, we will use a cursor to:

1. **Loop** through each movie title.
2. **Generate** a vector by calling Azure OpenAI.
3. **Store** the vector in the Movie table.

Run the following T-SQL code to vectorize each title in the **Movie** table and store the result in each row's **Vector** column:

```sql
DECLARE @MovieId int
DECLARE @Title varchar(max)
DECLARE @Vector vector(1536)

DECLARE curMovies CURSOR FOR
  SELECT MovieId, Title FROM Movie

OPEN curMovies
FETCH NEXT FROM curMovies INTO @MovieId, @Title

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
  -- Generate vector for movie title
  EXEC VectorizeText @Title, @Vector OUTPUT

  -- Store vector in the Movie table
  UPDATE Movie
  SET Vector = @Vector
  WHERE MovieId = @MovieId

  FETCH NEXT FROM curMovies INTO @MovieId, @Title
END

CLOSE curMovies
DEALLOCATE curMovies
GO
```

This code works by using a cursor to fetch each movie title. Azure OpenAI is called to vectorize each movie title using the `text-embedding-3-large` model, and the resulting vector values are stored back to the `Vector` column in the database with an `UPDATE` statement.

Run this code snippet, and then query the `Movie` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movie
GO
```

Observe that each movie title now has a **vector representation** stored in SQL Server.

## Create a Stored Procedure to Run a Vector Search

Now, we will create a stored procedure that uses **vector search** to find the most similar movie based on a natural language query. Traditional SQL searches rely on **exact text matching**, but vector search allows us to:

- Find movies **based on meaning**, not just words.  
- Handle **typos and variations** in queries.  
- Perform **AI-powered recommendations**.

Run the following T-SQL script to create the `MovieVectorSearch` stored procedure:

```sql
CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE MovieVectorSearch
  @Question varchar(max)
AS
BEGIN
  -- Prepare a vector variable to capture the question vector components
  DECLARE @QuestionVector vector(1536)

  -- Vectorize the question using Azure OpenAI
  EXEC VectorizeText @Question, @QuestionVector OUTPUT

  -- Find the most similar movie based on cosine similarity
  SELECT TOP 1 
    Question = @Question,
    Title, 
    CosineDistance = VECTOR_DISTANCE('cosine', @QuestionVector, Vector) -- New T-SQL function
  FROM Movie
  ORDER BY CosineDistance
END
GO
```

### How it Works

This stored procedure accepts a natural language query in the `@Question` parameter, and calls the `VectorizeText` stored procedure to vectorize the question (the same way that we vectorized movie titles in the `Movie` table). It then uses the new T-SQL `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function to retrieve the movie title that most similarly matches the question. Using `TOP 1` with `ORDER BY` on the calculated distance returns the most similar result, where the least distant is the most similar. This is based on the semantic meaning embedded in the movie database vectors and the user's query vector.

> **Note:** The `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function performs an exact vector search by scanning every vector in the table. This is commonly known as a **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** search. While not optimized for performance, it is simple to use and works well for small datasets like our movie titles. In the next lab, we’ll introduce **DiskANN**, which uses a disk-based **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** index to improve performance for extremely large datasets.

The stored procedure works as follows:

1. **Vectorizes** the user's question by calling `VectorizeText`.
2. **Finds the most similar movie** using `VECTOR_DISTANCE`.
3. **Returns the closest match**.

Observe that the `VECTOR_DISTANCE` function's first parameter accepts a "metric" property, which we are setting
as `cosine`. This means that we are calculating the **cosine distance** between the user's question and every movie in the database.

  - **Tip:** Cosine is the most commonly used distance metric, although others (including Dot Product and Euclidean) are also supported for specialized use cases.

## Run AI Queries

It's time to see the magic happen!

- Let's test **AI-powered search**.
- Instead of just **matching exact words** or **regular expressions**, our queries can now **understand meaning**.

### Try These Queries

Run the following T-SQL to see how the semantic meanings of the movie titles and the query text are matched by the `MovieVectorSearch` stored procedure.

- **Tip:** Run four executions at a time, for each of the five sets of stored procedures.

```sql
-- Movie phrases
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'May the force be with you'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'I''m gonna make him an offer he can''t refuse'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'One ring to rule them all'
```

```sql
-- Movie characters
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Luke Skywalker'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Don Corleone'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'James Blutarsky'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Gandalf'
```

```sql
-- Movie actors
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Mark Hamill'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Al Pacino'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'John Belushi'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Elijah Wood'
```

```sql
-- Movie location references
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Tatooine'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Sicily'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Faber College'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Mordor'
```

```sql
-- Movie genres
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Science fiction'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Crime'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Comedy'
EXEC MovieVectorSearch 'Fantasy/Adventure'
```

Notice how vector search finds the right movies, based on various attributes embedded in the vectors.

Remember, the only raw data in this database is movie titles. Yet, by supplementing that raw data with text embedding vectors from Azure OpenAI, we've achieved compelling AI search capabilities over our domain data.

**Congratulations! You have AI-enabled your SQL Server database.**

Before wrapping up, go ahead and add a few more `EXEC MovieVectorSearch` statements that match up against some of your favorite movies you added earlier in the lab. Have fun querying on the many well-known attributes of your favorite movies!
