# AI Features

The labs in this section introduce you to powerful new AI capabilities in SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL Database.

You will be working with **AI models** from **Azure Open AI**, which have already been deployed and made available prior to this lab.

In these labs, you will learn about:

* Vector Search
* Vector Utility Functions
* DiskANN Indexing
* RAG Solution
* Vector Utility Functions

These labs introduce the new intelligent capabilities in SQL Server 2025 and Azure SQL Database that bring machine learning and natural language understanding directly into T-SQL. You’ll learn how to perform **vector search** using the native `vector` data type to find semantically similar results, apply **vector utility functions** to normalize and inspect embeddings, use **DiskANN indexing** for fast and scalable approximate nearest neighbor searches, and build a complete **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solution that combines SQL Server’s vector search with Azure OpenAI models for context-aware answers grounded in your own data.

Together, these features transform SQL Server into an AI-powered data platform capable of meaning-based querying, reasoning, and intelligent application development.
