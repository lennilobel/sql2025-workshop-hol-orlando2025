# Multiplicative Aggregates with the PRODUCT Function

This lab explores the new `PRODUCT` function in SQL Server 2025, which calculates the product of a set of numeric values — similar to how `SUM` and `AVG` work for addition and averaging, but for multiplication.

Prior to SQL Server 2025, SQL Server lacked a built-in way to compute the product of values in a set. You had to use workarounds like looping or user-defined aggregates. With `PRODUCT`, this is now a simple one-line expression.

`PRODUCT` supports both aggregate and analytic (windowed) forms and works with both `ALL` values (default) and `DISTINCT` values. Nulls are ignored, and the function is compatible with all numeric types except `bit`.

In SSMS, right-click on the **AdventureWorks2022** database in Object Explorer and select **New Query** to open a new query window for this lab.

## Compute Product of Prices for Each Product

The first example illustrates how to use the new `PRODUCT` aggregate function in SQL Server 2025 to calculate the cumulative product of prices for each product across multiple orders. It also shows how to compute the product considering only distinct price values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE OrderDetail (
    OrderId     int,
    ProductId   int,
    Price       decimal(10, 4)
)

INSERT INTO OrderDetail
  (OrderId, ProductId,  Price) VALUES
  (1,       101,        136.87),
  (1,       102,        29.57),
  (1,       103,        396.85),
  (2,       101,        136.87),
  (2,       102,        29.57),
  (3,       101,        136.87),
  (3,       102,        29.57),
  (4,       101,        149.22),
  (4,       102,        29.57)

-- Compute product of all prices and distinct prices for each ProductId
SELECT
    ProductId,
    ProductOfPrices = PRODUCT(Price),
    ProductOfDistinctPrices = PRODUCT(DISTINCT Price)
FROM
    OrderDetail
GROUP BY
    ProductId
```

### Alternative using `OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`

This version computes the product for each row using a windowed aggregate (that is, using `OVER` rather than `GROUP BY`). This allows you to retain the detail rows (which were lost in the previous `GROUP BY` query) while also showing the total product per partition.

```sql
SELECT
    OrderId,
    ProductId,
    Price,
    ProductOfPrices = PRODUCT(Price) OVER (PARTITION BY ProductId)
FROM
    OrderDetail
```

## Compounded Return from Periodic Rates

The next example uses `PRODUCT` to compute the **compounded return** for financial instruments over multiple time periods.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Instrument (
    InstrumentId    varchar(10),
    Period          tinyint,
    RateOfReturn    decimal(10, 4)
)

INSERT INTO Instrument
  (InstrumentId,    Period, RateOfReturn) VALUES
  ('BOND1',         1,      0.035),
  ('BOND1',         2,      0.0275),
  ('BOND1',         3,      0.0325),
  ('ETF1',          1,      0.08),
  ('ETF1',          2,      -0.045),
  ('ETF1',          3,      0.06),
  ('STOCK1',        1,      0.125),
  ('STOCK1',        2,      0.095),
  ('STOCK1',        3,      0.113)

-- Compute compounded return for each instrument
SELECT
  InstrumentId,
  CompoundedReturn = PRODUCT(1 + RateOfReturn) - 1,
  CompoundedReturnPercentage = FORMAT((PRODUCT(1 + RateOfReturn) - 1) * 100, 'N1') || '%'
FROM
  Instrument
GROUP BY
  InstrumentId
```

The above query calculates the compounded return for each instrument by taking the product of `(1 + RateOfReturn)` for all periods and then subtracting 1 to return the `CompoundedReturn` column. The `CompoundedReturnPercentage` column shows the same value formatted for display as a percentage with one decimal place.

Using BOND1 as an example, the calculation would be:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| (1 + 0.035) = 1.035 | * | Period 1 return |
| (1 + 0.0275) = 1.0275 | * | Period 2 return |
| (1 + 0.0325) = 1.0325 | = | Period 3 return |
| 1.098026 | - 1 = | Growth factor (includes the original principal $1) |
| 0.098026 | = | Compounded return (i.e., the percentage gain) |
| **9.8%** | | Isolated profit/loss percentage |

### Alternative using `OVER (PARTITION BY ...)`

Like the first example, this version uses windowing with `OVER` to calculate the compounded return for each individual row.

```sql
SELECT
  InstrumentId,
  Period,
  RateOfReturn,
  CompoundedReturn = PRODUCT(1 + RateOfReturn) OVER (PARTITION BY InstrumentId) - 1,
  CompoundedReturnPercentage = FORMAT((PRODUCT(1 + RateOfReturn) OVER (PARTITION BY InstrumentId) - 1) * 100,'N1') || '%'
FROM
  Instrument
```

### Cleanup

Now delete the tables created for this lab:

```sql
DROP TABLE OrderDetail
DROP TABLE Instrument
```
