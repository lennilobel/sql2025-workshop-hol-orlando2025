The updated HOL now integrates context about the legacy SQL Server 2000 functions (`SOUNDEX` and `DIFFERENCE`) alongside each modern similarity scoring section. This helps readers understand the historical background and why the 2025 functions are more precise and suited for ranking and composite scoring.

Let me know if you’d like to add:

* A comparative table of old vs. new functions
* Visuals or diagrams explaining the scoring scale
* A practice challenge at the end of the lab
