# Regular Expressions in SQL Server 2025

SQL Server 2025 introduces long-awaited first-class support for regular expressions via a suite of new built-in functions that allow you to search, extract, count, split, and replace text patterns—all directly within T-SQL.

In this lab, you will:

* Use `REGEXP_LIKE` to validate email and phone formats
* Use `REGEXP_COUNT` to analyze the presence of specific words or patterns
* Extract substrings with `REGEXP_SUBSTR`
* Locate patterns using `REGEXP_INSTR`
* Clean or transform data using `REGEXP_REPLACE`
* Extract multiple values using `REGEXP_MATCHES`
* Tokenize text with `REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE`

By the end, you'll be equipped to perform advanced text parsing and validation scenarios natively in T-SQL—no CLR or external libraries required.

## Set Up the Review Table

In SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), right-click on the **HolDb** database in Object Explorer and select **New Query** to open a new query window for this lab.

We'll begin by creating a table named `Review`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Review (
  ReviewId      int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Name          varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  Email         varchar(150),
  Phone         varchar(20),
  ReviewText    varchar(1000)
)
```

Now populate the `Review` table with sample data, including rows with invalid email addresses and phone numbers, and rows with hashtags in the review text.

```sql
INSERT INTO Review
  (Name,                    Email,                      Phone,          ReviewText) VALUES
  ('John Doe',	            'john@contoso.com',         '123-4567890',  'This product is excellent! I really like the build quality and design. #camera #quality'),
  ('Alice Smith',           'alice@fabrikam@com',       '234-567-81',   'Good value for money, but the software is terrible. #microphone'),
  ('Mary Jo Anne Erickson', 'mary.jo.anne@acme.co.uk',  '456-789-1234', 'Poor battery life,   bad camera performance,   and poor build quality. #camera #performance'),
  ('Max Wong',              'max@fabrikam.com',         NULL,	        'Excellent service from the support team, highly recommended!\t#microsoft #teams'),
  ('Bob Johnson',           'bob.fabrikam.net',         '345-678-9012', 'The product is good, but delivery was delayed.\r\nOverall, decent experience.'),
  ('Terri S Duffy',         'terri.duffy@acme.com',     '678-901-2345', 'Battery life is weak, camera quality is poor. #camera #battery'),
  ('Eve Jones',             NULL,                       '456-789-0123', 'I love this product, it''s great! #fantastic #amazon #delivery'),
  ('Charlie Brown',         'charlie@contoso.co.in',    '587-890-1234', 'I hate this product, it''s terrible!')
```

## Validate Email and Phone with `REGEXP_LIKE`

The `REGEXP_LIKE` function can be used in the `WHERE` clause of a query to test whether a column matches a given regular expression.

First, let's retrieve all rows with a valid email address.

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Email
FROM
  Review
WHERE
  REGEXP_LIKE(
    Email,
    '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
  )
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `^`       | Start of string |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` | One or more letters, digits, dot, underscore, percent, plus, or hyphen |
| `@`       | Literal @ before the domain |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` | One or more letters, digits, dot, or hyphen for the domain name |
| `\.`      | Literal . before the top-level domain |
| `[a-zA-Z]{2,}` | At least two letters for the top-level domain (e.g., com, org, co, uk) |
| `$`       | End of string |


You should only see rows with email addresses that follow the correct format. Malformed addresses like `bob.fabrikam.net` or `alice@fabrikam@com` as well as `NULL` values should be excluded.

Now let's refine the regular expression pattern to return rows with a valid email address ending in **.com**:

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Email
FROM
  Review
WHERE
  REGEXP_LIKE(
    Email,
    '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.com$'
  )
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `^`       | Start of string |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+` | One or more letters, digits, dot, underscore, percent, plus, or hyphen |
| `@`       | Literal @ before the domain |
| `[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+` | One or more letters, digits, dot, or hyphen for the domain name |
| `\.com`   | Literal . before the top-level domain which must be "com" |
| `$`       | End of string |

We've now filtered our valid email address list down to include only email addresses ending in **.com**. Other valid email addresses like `mary.jo.anne@acme.co.uk` or `charlie@contoso.co.in` are excluded.

Now let's use a similar query with a different regular expression pattern to check for valid phone numbers:

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Phone
FROM
  Review
WHERE
  REGEXP_LIKE(
    Phone,
    '^(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})$'
  )
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `^`       | Start of string |
| `(\d{3})` | Match exactly 3 digits (area code) |
| `-`       | Literal hyphen |
| `(\d{3})` | Match exactly 3 digits (first part of the phone number) |
| `-`       | Literal hyphen |
| `(\d{4})` | Match exactly 4 digits (second part of the phone number) |
| `$`       | End of string |

You should only see rows where phone numbers are fully structured with hyphens and correct digit groups. Malformed phone numbers like `123-4567890` or `234-567-81` should be excluded, as well as `NULL` values.

## Analyze Patterns with `REGEXP_COUNT`

Use `REGEXP_COUNT` when you want to count the number of times a pattern appears in a column or expression. It's useful for validation or keyword analysis. It is also useful as an alternative to `REGEXP_LIKE` when used in a conditional expression in the `SELECT` clause, where `REGEXP_LIKE` cannot be used.

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Email,
  IsEmailValid = CASE WHEN REGEXP_COUNT(Email, '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$') = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
  Phone,
  IsPhoneValid = CASE WHEN REGEXP_COUNT(Phone, '^(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})$') = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
FROM
  Review
```

This query returns all the rows from the `Review` table, with `IsEmailValid` and `IsPhoneValid` columns indicating whether the email address and phone number fields are valid or not. Because `REGEXP_LIKE` is not allowed anywhere other than a `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement, we need to use `REGEXP_COUNT` instead, using the same regular expression pattern, and testing for a match count of exactly one.

Here's another example where `REGEXP_COUNT` is used to count the number of vowels in the `Name` column of each row:

```sql
SELECT
  Name,
  VowelCount = REGEXP_COUNT(
    Name,
    '[AEIOU]',
    1,  -- start position
    'i' -- case insensitive flag (match uppercase or lowercase vowels)
  )  
FROM
  Review
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following single component:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `[AEIOU]` | Match any single uppercase vowel (A, E, I, O, U) |

Note that this query uses the `i` flag to make the match case-insensitive. So even though the regular expression specifies uppercase vowels only, it will count both uppercase and lowercase vowels (e.g., `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).

We can also count the number of positive and negative "sentiment" keywords found in the review text of each row:

```sql
SELECT
  Name,
  ReviewText,
  GoodSentimentWordCount = REGEXP_COUNT(
    ReviewText,
    '\b(excellent|great|good|love|like)\b',
    1,  -- start position
    'i' -- case insensitive flag
  ),
  BadSentimentWordCount = REGEXP_COUNT(
    ReviewText,
    '\b(bad|poor|terrible|hate)\b',
    1,  -- start position
    'i' -- case insensitive flag
  )
FROM
  Review
```

The `GoodSentimentWordCount` regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `\b`      | Start of word boundary |
| `(excellent\|great\|good\|love\|like)` | Match any of the words in the parentheses (positive sentiment) |
| `\b`      | End of word boundary |

Simlarly, the `BadSentimentWordCount` regular expression pattern has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `\b`      | Start of word boundary |
| `(bad\|poor\|terrible\|hate)` | Match any of the words in the parentheses (negative sentiment) |
| `\b`      | End of word boundary |

## `REGEXP_LIKE` with CHECK Constraints

You can also use `REGEXP_LIKE` in the CHECK constraint of a table definition. This guarantees that invalid data (that is, text that doesn't match the regular expression pattern) will never be accepted into the table.

Run the following statement to create a CHECK constraint that allows only valid email addresses in the `Email` column of the `Review` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Review 
  ADD CONSTRAINT CK_ValidEmail CHECK (Email IS NULL OR REGEXP_LIKE(Email, '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'))
```

As you may have expected, this statement fails because we already have invalid email addresses in our data that violates this constraint.

Now try to create a CHECK constraint that only permits valid phone numbers in the `Phone` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Review 
  ADD CONSTRAINT CK_ValidPhone CHECK (Phone IS NULL OR REGEXP_LIKE(Phone, '^(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})$'))
```

Likewise, this statement fails  because we also have invalid phone numbers in our data that violates this constraint.

We'll use a brute-force approach to rid our table of invalid data. Simply delete all rows with invalid (and non-`NULL`) email addresses or phone numbers:

```sql
DELETE FROM Review
WHERE
  (Email IS NOT NULL AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Email, '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$')) OR
  (Phone IS NOT NULL AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(Phone, '^(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})$'))
```

We can now create those two CHECK constraints on the `Review` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Review 
  ADD CONSTRAINT CK_ValidEmail CHECK (Email IS NULL OR REGEXP_LIKE(Email, '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'))

ALTER TABLE Review 
  ADD CONSTRAINT CK_ValidPhone CHECK (Phone IS NULL OR REGEXP_LIKE(Phone, '^(\d{3})-(\d{3})-(\d{4})$'))
```

Now let's test the first constraint by attempting to insert a row with an invalid email address:

```sql
INSERT INTO Review VALUES
  ('Invalid Email', 'invalid-email@com', '123-456-7890', 'Review')
```

As expected, the `INSERT` statement fails because it violates the `CK_ValidEmail` CHECK constraint we put in place on the `Email` column (**invalid-email@com** is not a valid email address).

Similarly, let's test the second constraint using an invalid phone number:

```sql
INSERT INTO Review VALUES
  ('Invalid Phone', 'valid-email@gmail.com', '234-342-INVALID', 'Review')
```

Once again, the `INSERT` statement fails, this time because it violates the `CK_ValidPhone` CHECK constraint we have on the `Phone` column (**234-342-INVALID** is not a valid phone number).

Of course, perfectly valid email addresses and phone numbers are readily accepted into the the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Review
  (Name,             Email,                          Phone,          ReviewText) VALUES
  ('John Doe',       'john@fabrikam.com',            '123-456-7890', 'This product is excellent! I really like the build quality and design. #camera #quality'),
  ('Alice Smith',    'alice.smith@fabrikam.co.uk',   '234-567-8195', 'Good value for money, but the software is terrible.'),
  ('Bob Johnson',    'bob@fabrikam.com',             '345-678-9012', 'The product is good, but delivery was delayed. Overall, decent experience.'),
  ('Stuart Green',   'stuart.green@acme.com',        '456-789-0123', 'Pretty good product, I am enjoying it!')
```

Now query the table to observe the current data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Review
```

## Extract Substrings with `REGEXP_SUBSTR`

You can use `REGEXP_SUBSTR` to extract parts of strings that match a given regular expression pattern. For example, you can identify email domain names as a substring of the complete email address in the `Email` column:

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Email,
  DomainName = REGEXP_SUBSTR(
    Email,
    '@(.+)$',
    1,      -- start position
    1,      -- return the first occurrence
    'c',    -- enable capture group indexing
    1)      -- return the first capture group, which is the domain name
FROM
  Review
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `@`       | Match the literal at-symbol |
| `(.+)$`   | Capture everything after the at-symbol until the end of the string (the domain name) |

By enabling capture group indexing with the `c` flag, we can extract the first capture group (the domain name) using `1` for the last parameter.

If we extract the domain name in a common table expression (CTE), then we can easily use `GROUP BY` and `COUNT(*)` to identify how many email addresses we have per domain:

```sql
;WITH DomainNameCte AS (
  SELECT 
    DomainName = REGEXP_SUBSTR(
      Email,
      '@(.+)$',
      1,    -- start position
      1,    -- return the first occurrence
      'c',  -- enable capture group indexing
      1)    -- return the first capture group, which is the domain name
  FROM
    Review
)
SELECT
  DomainName,
  DomainCount = COUNT(*)
FROM
  DomainNameCte
GROUP BY
  DomainName
ORDER BY
  DomainName
```

## Locate Patterns with `REGEXP_INSTR`

Use `REGEXP_INSTR` to find the character position where a pattern occurs. It's useful for indexing into strings or diagnosing structural issues. For example:

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  Email,
  At        = REGEXP_INSTR(Email, '@'),
  NextDot   = REGEXP_INSTR(Email, '@[^@]*?(\.)',
    1,      -- start position
    1,      -- return the first occurrence
    0,      -- return the position of the match (not the position after it)
    'c',    -- enable capture group indexing
    1       -- return the position of the first capture group, which is the dot
  )
FROM
  Review
```

The regular expression patterns in this query have the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `@`       | Match the literal at-symbol |
| `[^@]*?`  | Match everything after the at-symbol until the first dot (non-greedy) |
| `(\.)`    | Capture the first dot after the at-symbol |

For example:

```plaintext
           1         2
  12345678901234567890123456
  alice.smith@fabrikam.co.uk
             ^        ^
             |        |
             |        +-- match first dot after @ = 21
             +-- match starts at @
```

This query uses `REGEXP_INSTR` to locate the position of the `@` in each email address. Of course, that's a simple string where the age-old `CHARINDEX` function could have been used just as easily. However, we then use `REGEXP_INSTR` again to locate the first `.` symbol after the `@` symbol, and this is something that cannot be achieved with `CHARINDEX`.

## Transform Strings with `REGEXP_REPLACE`

Use `REGEXP_REPLACE` to modify strings based on pattern matches. For instance, you can strip out middle names, like so:

```sql
SELECT
  ReviewId,
  Name,
  ShortName = REGEXP_REPLACE(
    Name,
    '^(\S+)\s+.*\s+(\S+)$',
    '\1 \2',
    1,  -- start position
    1,  -- replace only the first occurrence
    'i' -- case insensitive flag (optional, but safe to include)
  )
FROM
  Review
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `^(\S+)`  | Match the first word (non-whitespace characters) at the start of the string and capture it |
| `\s+.*\s+` | Match one or more whitespace characters, followed by any characters (the middle names), followed by one or more whitespace characters |
| `(\S+)$`  | Match the last word (non-whitespace characters) at the end of the string and capture it |


The replacement string `'\1 \2'` uses the captured groups to construct the new string, which consists of the first and last names separated by a space.


Observe that "Mary Jo Anne Erickson" is transformed to "Mary Erickson", removing the middle names and leaving only first and last.

## Extract Multiple Matches with `REGEXP_MATCHES`

Use `REGEXP_MATCHES` to return all matches of a pattern in a string. For example, to extract hashtags from longer text fields:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM REGEXP_MATCHES('Learning #AzureSQL #AzureSQLDB', '#([A-Za-z0-9_]+)')
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `#`       | Match the literal hash symbol |
| `([A-Za-z0-9_]+)` | Capture one or more letters, digits, or underscores (the hashtag text) |

The `REGEXP_MATCHES` function returns multiple rows for each input row (one for each match); that is, it is a table-valued function (TVF). Observe that it provides the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `match_id` | Incrementing identifier for each match |
| `start_position` | Starting position of each match (0-based index) |
| `end_position` | Ending position of each match (0-based index) |
| `match_value` | The actual matched text (the hashtag) |
| `substring_matches` | A JSON representation of the matched text, starting position (1-based), and length of each match |`

Because this function is implemented as a TVF, you can use `CROSS APPLY` to join the TVF result set to the outer `Review` rows, preserving the relationship between the review and its extracted hashtags.

```sql
SELECT
  r.ReviewId,
  r.ReviewText,
  HashtagNumber = m.match_id,
  Hashtag = m.match_value
FROM
  Review AS r
  CROSS APPLY REGEXP_MATCHES(r.ReviewText, '#([A-Za-z0-9_]+)') AS m
```

Observe how this query returns one row for each hashtag, along with the corresponding review text from which the hashtag was extracted.

## Split Text with `REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE`

Our last regular expression function is `REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE`. This is also implemented as a table-valued function (TVF), which can break up (or "tokenize") long strings into individual components. This can be useful for word frequency analysis, indexing, or keyword detection.

For example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(
    'the quick brown    fox jumped' || char(9) || 'over the lazy' || char(13) || char(10) || 'dogs',
    '\s+'
  )    
```

The regular expression pattern in this query has the following component:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `\s+`     | Match one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) |


Notice how *any* combination of white space (including tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds) is treated as a *single* delimeter for splitting the input text. 

Once again, being a table-valued function (TVF), simply use `CROSS APPLY` to run the function against every review in the table:

```sql
SELECT
  r.ReviewId,
  r.ReviewText,
  WordText      = s.value,
  WordPosition  = s.ordinal
FROM
  Review AS r
  CROSS APPLY REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(r.ReviewText, '\s+') AS s
```

Notice how each word in the review is returned in its own row, with `WordPosition` indicating its order.

If you also wanted to strip the punctuation from each word for a cleaner analysis (particularly helpful when a #hashtag is embedded within the text), simply add in a `REGEXP_REPLACE` on the `value` column returned by `REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE`, as follows:

```sql
SELECT
  r.ReviewId,
  r.ReviewText,
  WordText        = REGEXP_REPLACE(s.value, '[^\w]', '', 1, 0, 'i'),
  WordPosition    = s.ordinal
FROM
  Review AS r
  CROSS APPLY REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(r.ReviewText, '\s+') AS s
```

The regular expression pattern in this query's `REGEXP_REPLACE` function has the following component:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `[^\w]`   | Match any character that is not a word character (letters, digits, or underscores) |

This effectively removes any punctuation or special characters from the words, leaving you with a clean list of words for further analysis.

## Cleanup

Before concluding this lab, cleanup by deleting the `Review` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE Review
```
