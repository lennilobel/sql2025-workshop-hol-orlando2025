# Fuzzy Matching Functions

Fuzzy string matching is the process of finding strings that are approximately equal, but not necessarily exactly equal. This is essential for tasks like data cleaning, deduplication, primitive natural language search, and matching user input against a known set of values. SQL Server 2025 introduces several new fuzzy matching functions to help you identify similar words and phrases directly in T-SQL.

### Legacy Fuzzy Matching Functions

T-SQL has supported what are now referred to as "legacy" fuzzy matching functions since SQL Server 2000:

- SOUNDEX
- DIFFERENCE

The `SOUNDEX` function calculates a code for the phonetic representation of a piece of text (for example, **Green** and **Greener** get calculated as **G650** and **G656**, respectively).

The `DIFFERENCE` function measures the distance between the phonetic representations of two pieces of text (that is, the `SOUNDEX` result of each), and returns a number from 1 (most dissimilar) to 4 (exact or almost exact). For example, **Green** and **Greener** gets calculated as 3, which means "very close". Meanwhile **Gray** and **Grey** are considered "almost exact", and they each generate the same `SOUNDEX` code of **G600** and yield a result of 4 (exact or almost exact)

However, these functions are not ideal for use with long strings. They are also less granular than the new fuzzy matching functions introduced in SQL Server 2025.

### New SQL Server 2025 Fuzzy Matching Functions

SQL Server 2025 introduces four new fuzzy matching functions that yield more granular (and therefore, more accurate) results than the two legacy functions provide. These give you four alternative methods for determining the distance or similarity between two pieces of text.


| Function Name | Description |
| - | - |
| EDIT_DISTANCE | Basic character-level changes. Aka Levenshtein distance. |
| EDIT_DISTANCE_SIMILARITY | Aka Levenshtein similarity. |
| JARO_WINKLER_DISTANCE | ... |
| JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY | When transpositions and minor typos are common. |

Let's get started learning how to use these new fuzzy matching functions.

## Create the WordPair Table

First create a table to hold word pairs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE WordPair (
  WordPairId    int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  Word1         varchar(50),
  Word2         varchar(50)
)
```

Now populate the table with a variety of different word pairs. These entries will help you explore fuzzy matching in practice.

```sql
INSERT INTO WordPair VALUES
 ('Colour',     'Color'),
 ('Flavour',    'Flavor'),
 ('Centre',     'Center'),
 ('Theatre',    'Theater'),
 ('Theatre',    'Theatrics'),
 ('Theatre',    'Theatrical'),
 ('Organise',   'Organize'),
 ('Analyse',    'Analyze'),
 ('Catalogue',  'Catalog'),
 ('Programme',  'Program'),
 ('Metre',      'Meter'),
 ('Honour',     'Honor'),
 ('Neighbour',  'Neighbor'),
 ('Travelling', 'Traveling'),
 ('Grey',       'Gray'),
 ('Green',      'Greene'),
 ('Green',      'Greener'),
 ('Green',      'Greenery'),
 ('Green',      'Greenest'),
 ('Orange',     'Purple'),      -- very different
 ('Defence',    'Defense'),
 ('Practise',   'Practice'),
 ('Practice',   'Practice'),    -- identical
 ('Aluminium',  'Aluminum'),
 ('Cheque',     'Check')
```

Now run this query to compare each word pair using both the new and legacy fuzzy matching functions:

```sql
SELECT
  *,
  -- New SQL Server 2025 fuzzy matching functions
  LevenshteinDistance     = EDIT_DISTANCE(Word1, Word2),
  LevenshteinSimilarity   = EDIT_DISTANCE_SIMILARITY(Word1, Word2),
  JaroWrinklerDistance    = JARO_WINKLER_DISTANCE(Word1, Word2),
  JaroWrinklerSimilarity  = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(Word1, Word2),
  -- Legacy SQL Server fuzzy matching functions
  Soundex1                = SOUNDEX(Word1),
  Soundex2                = SOUNDEX(Word2),
  Difference              = DIFFERENCE(Word1, Word2)
FROM
  WordPair
ORDER BY 
  LevenshteinSimilarity DESC
```

Notice that we are sorting descending by Levenshtein similarity (the `EDIT_DISTANCE_SIMILARITY` function). This is from 0 to 100, where 100 means exact match. That places the identically spelled words **Practice** at the top of the list. The remaining words that have different spellings are then listed in order of similarity strength.

Take the time to scan the results. Observe how the values in the various score columns change with each word pair, as each pair becomes less and less similar. The worst result appears at the bottom, with the most dissimilar word pair **Orange** and **Purple**.

Cleanup now, by deleting the `WordPair` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE WordPair
```

## Analyze Customer Data

Now let's move on to a more realistic scenario involving potential duplicates in a customer table. The goal is to evaluate similarities in first names, last names, and addresses to identify potential duplicate rows.

First create the `Customer` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  CustomerId int IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  FirstName varchar(50),
  LastName varchar(50),
  Address varchar(100)
)
```

Now populate the table with a bunch of rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO Customer VALUES
 ('Johnathan',  'Smith',    '123 North Main Street'),
 ('Jonathan',   'Smith',    '123 N Main St.'),
 ('Johnathan',  'Smith',    '456 Ocean View Blvd'),
 ('Johnathan',  'Smith',    '123 North Main Street'),
 ('Daniel',     'Smith',    '123 N. Main St.'),
 ('Danny',      'Smith',    '123 N. Main St.'),
 ('John',       'Smith',    '123 Main Street'),
 ('Jonathon',   'Smyth',    '123 N Main St'),
 ('Jon',        'Smith',    '123 N Main St.'),
 ('Johnny',     'Smith',    '124 N Main St'),
 ('Ethan',      'Goldberg', '742 Evergreen Terrace'),
 ('Carlos',     'Rivera',   '456 Ocean View Boulevard'),
 ('Carlos',     'Rivera',   '456 Ocean View Blvd'),
 ('Carl',       'Rivera',   '456 Ocean View Boulevard'),
 ('Carlos',     'Rivera',   '456 Ocean View Boulevard')

SELECT * FROM Customer
```

There are similar and dissimilar spellings in this data across the `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Address` fields. First, we'll analyze these three fields individually. Then we'll combine the similarity results of all three fields to identify the most likely duplicate rows overall.

Also, we’ll use  the `JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY` function for this, as it's better suited than the other functions for measuring small variations, insertions, deletions, and transpositions.

## Score First Name Similarity

Let's first identify customers who might be the same person despite variations in their first name. This will help uncover cases like **Johnathan** vs **Jonathan**, or **Jon** vs **Johnny**, for example.

```sql
;WITH PairwiseSimilarityCte AS (
  SELECT
    CustomerId1         = c1.CustomerId,
    CustomerId2         = c2.CustomerId,
    FirstName1          = c1.FirstName,
    FirstName2          = c2.FirstName,
    FirstNameSimilarity = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.FirstName, c2.FirstName)
  FROM
    Customer AS c1
    INNER JOIN Customer AS c2 ON c2.CustomerId < c1.CustomerId
)
SELECT
  *,
  FirstNameQuality = CASE
    WHEN FirstNameSimilarity = 1    THEN 'Exact'
    WHEN FirstNameSimilarity >= .85 THEN 'Very Strong'
    WHEN FirstNameSimilarity >= .75 THEN 'Strong'
    WHEN FirstNameSimilarity >= .4  THEN 'Weak'
                                    ELSE 'Very Weak'
    END
FROM
  PairwiseSimilarityCte
ORDER BY
  FirstNameSimilarity DESC
```

The `PairwiseSimilarityCte` CTE first calculates the similarity between each unique combination of rows. It does this by joining the `Customer` table on itself, and then applying the `JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY` function to all `FirstName` combinations.

We then query the CTE, and assign Exact, Very Strong, Strong, Weak, and Very Weak labels to each row, based on defined thresholds for similarity.

You should see all the exact matches at the very top. After that you will see matches that score very highly, like **Johnathan** and **Jonathan**, as well as **Jon** and **John**. Conversely, observe that **Daniel** and **Johnathan** rank much lower further down the list.

## Score Last Name Similarity

For last names, phonetic similarity is often important—for example, names like **Smith** and **Smyth** are pronounced identically.

```sql
;WITH PairwiseSimilarityCte AS (
  SELECT
    CustomerId1         = c1.CustomerId,
    CustomerId2         = c2.CustomerId,
    LastName1           = c1.LastName,
    LastName2           = c2.LastName,
    LastNameSimilarity  = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.LastName, c2.LastName)
  FROM
    Customer AS c1
    INNER JOIN Customer AS c2 ON c2.CustomerId < c1.CustomerId
)
SELECT
  *,
  LastNameQuality = CASE
    WHEN LastNameSimilarity = 1     THEN 'Exact'
    WHEN LastNameSimilarity >= .85  THEN 'Very Strong'
    WHEN LastNameSimilarity >= .75  THEN 'Strong'
    WHEN LastNameSimilarity >= .4   THEN 'Weak'
                                    ELSE 'Very Weak'
    END
FROM
    PairwiseSimilarityCte
ORDER BY
    LastNameSimilarity DESC
```

This query takes the same approach as the previous query to process all row combinations, but checks the `LastName` field for similarity rather than `FirstName`. Expect all **Smith** pairs to be rated Exact, while **Smith** vs. **Smyth** is rated Very Strong due to their slight difference. Meanwhile, totally dissimilar last names like **Goldberg** and **Smith** are rated much lower down the list as Very Weak.

## Score Address Similarity

Address fields can be particularly noisy due to abbreviations (**St.** vs **Street**), misspellings, or inconsistent formats. Here again, `JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY` excels by providing a similarity score that accounts for both transpositions and partial matches—great for identifying variations that still represent the same location.

So now let's compare customer addresses to determine whether small variations (like abbreviations or alternate formats) still point to the same physical location.

```sql
;WITH PairwiseSimilarityCte AS (
  SELECT
    CustomerId1         = c1.CustomerId,
    CustomerId2         = c2.CustomerId,
    Address1            = c1.Address,
    Address2            = c2.Address,
    AddressSimilarity   = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.Address, c2.Address)
  FROM
    Customer AS c1
    INNER JOIN Customer AS c2 ON c2.CustomerId < c1.CustomerId
)
SELECT
  *,
  AddressQuality = CASE
    WHEN AddressSimilarity = 1      THEN 'Exact'
    WHEN AddressSimilarity >= .85   THEN 'Very Strong'
    WHEN AddressSimilarity >= .75   THEN 'Strong'
    WHEN AddressSimilarity >= .4    THEN 'Weak'
                                    ELSE 'Very Weak'
  END
FROM
  PairwiseSimilarityCte
ORDER BY
  AddressSimilarity DESC
```

Once again, perfectly matching addresses appear at the top, ranked as "Exact". Then you see closely related entries like **123 North Main Street** and **123 N Main St.** follow. You should see that **456 Ocean View Boulevard** and alternatives like **456 Ocean View Blvd** also score highly. Conversely, notice how very dissimilar addresses score, such as **742 Evergreen Terrace** and **123 N. Main St.**, appear much further down toward the bottom of the list.

## Combine All Scores

Of course, two similar names with dissimilar addresses is probably not a duplicate. So finally, we'll calculate a composite score across all three fields to more confidently detect near-duplicates overall.

To do this, we'll combine the three dimensions—first name, last name, and address—into a single average similarity score. This provides a holistic view of how likely two rows actually refer to the same individual.

```sql
;WITH PairwiseSimilarityCte AS (
  SELECT
    CustomerId1         = c1.CustomerId,
    CustomerId2         = c2.CustomerId,
    FirstName1          = c1.FirstName,
    FirstName2          = c2.FirstName,
    FirstNameSimilarity = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.FirstName, c2.FirstName),
    LastName1           = c1.LastName,
    LastName2           = c2.LastName,
    LastNameSimilarity  = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.LastName, c2.LastName),
    Address1            = c1.Address,
    Address2            = c2.Address,
    AddressSimilarity   = JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY(c1.Address, c2.Address)
  FROM
    Customer AS c1
    INNER JOIN Customer AS c2 ON c2.CustomerId < c1.CustomerId
),
FinalCombinedScoreCte AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    FinalCombinedScore = (FirstNameSimilarity + LastNameSimilarity + AddressSimilarity) / 3.0
  FROM
    PairwiseSimilarityCte
)
SELECT
  *,
  FinalQuality = CASE
    WHEN FinalCombinedScore = 1     THEN 'Exact'
    WHEN FinalCombinedScore >= .85  THEN 'Very Strong'
    WHEN FinalCombinedScore >= .75  THEN 'Strong'
    WHEN FinalCombinedScore >= .4   THEN 'Weak'
                                    ELSE 'Very Weak'
  END
FROM
  FinalCombinedScoreCte
ORDER BY
  FinalCombinedScore DESC
```

Like the previous three queries, the `PairwiseSimilarityCte` CTE first calculates the similarity between each unique combination of rows; but now, we calculate the `JARO_WINKLER_SIMILARITY` for all three columns.

Then, `FinalCombinedScoreCte` queries `PairwiseSimilarityCte`, and calculates a combined score as an average across the three individual similarity scores.

Finally, we query `FinalCombinedScoreCte`, and assign Exact, Very Strong, Strong, Weak, and Very Weak labels to each row, based on defined thresholds for similarity, and sort descending on the combined score of each customer row.

The first two results show exact duplicates; that is, rows where all three fields `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Address` are identical across multiple rows. After that, other potential (non-exact) duplicates appear in order of likelihood, based on the combined similarities of all three fields.

For example, **Jonathon Smyth, 123 N Main St** and **Johnathan Smith, 456 Ocean View Blvd** score high similarity results on first and last name, but much lower on address. And so that instance ranks lower down the list as a potential duplicate. Conversely, **Jonathon Smyth, 123 N Main St** and **Johnathan Smith, 123 North Main Street** score high for similarity on all three fields, and thus appear much higher up in the list as a more likely duplicate.

To cleanup, delete the `Customer` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE Customer
```
