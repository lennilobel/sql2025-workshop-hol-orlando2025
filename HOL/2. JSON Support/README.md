# Exploring New JSON Capabilities in SQL Server 2025

SQL Server 2025 introduces several powerful enhancements to its native JSON support, addressing long-standing gaps in performance, usability, and standards compliance. These features make JSON a first-class citizen alongside traditional relational data types.

This hands-on lab walks you through the new JSON features introduced in SQL Server 2025:

* Native `json` data type
* In-place updates using the `.modify()` method
* JSON path indexing with `CREATE JSON INDEX`
* JSON path expression array enhancements
* JSON aggregates
* The new `RETURNING` clause for type-safe extraction with `JSON_VALUE`
* The new `JSON_CONTAINS` function for containment checks
