# Using the `RETURNING` Clause for Type-Safe Extraction

The new `RETURNING` clause on `JSON_VALUE` lets you specify a SQL type for the extracted scalar—improving correctness and plan quality compared with wrapping the function in an external `CAST/CONVERT`. It is **ANSI‑compliant** and avoids surprises with string comparisons.

## Using `RETURNING`

`JSON_VALUE` traditionally returns a string type. Comparing that to a decimal number uses string semantics (e.g., `'100' < '9'`), which results in an error. For example, retrieving customers with a balance greater than $50.25:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE JSON_VALUE(CustomerJson, '$.balance') > 50.25
```

You can see that this fails because the `>` operator cannot compare the string returned by `JSON_VALUE` to a numeric type. Instead, you must coerce to a numeric type to get proper numeric comparisons. The new `RETURNING` clause bakes this coercion into the extraction:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE JSON_VALUE(CustomerJson, '$.balance' RETURNING decimal) > 50.25
```
